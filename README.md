# Coffee Shop Orders ‚òïüçÇ
A prototype two-tier web application where users can place, edit, and delete coffee and food orders.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js**, with active client‚Äìserver communication.  

Go ahead and read the menu then input your order and name into the input text boxes.  After that, click the Show results button to see all the current orders in the table, and feel free to edit / remove your order as you need.  Or place a new one by inputting more data!

CSS positioning technique:  flexbox layout

The app maintains a dataset of orders in memory and automatically adds a **derived field**:  
`readyInMin`, the estimated preparation time based on the drink/food ordered.

### Disclaimer 
- When adding a new order, make sure to update the table using the **Show Results** button.  When editing and deleting the table should update on it's own since internally it calls teh `updateResults()` function.

## How to Run
1. Clone or fork this repository.  
2. Install dependencies (only `mime` is required):  
   `npm install`
3. Start the server:  
  `node server.improved.js`
  or
  `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Features (Baseline Requirements)

- **Server**  
  - Serves static files (`index.html`, `main.css`, `main.js`).  
  - Maintains an in-memory dataset with fields:  
    - `id`, `name`, `drink`, `food`, `createdOn`, and derived `readyInMin`.  

- **Results Functionality**  
  - `/results` endpoint returns all orders in JSON.  
  - Displayed in an HTML `<table>` dynamically updated on the client side by clicking the **Show Results** button.

- **Form/Entry Functionality**  
  - Users can submit new orders with name, drink, and food.  
  - Each row in the results table has **Edit** and **Delete** buttons.  

- **Server Logic**  
  - When a new order is received, the server runs `getPrepTimeInMin(drink, food)`  
    to compute `readyInMin` before saving the order.  
  - Logic that adds prep time (in mins) based on the food and rnk ordered.

- **Derived Field**  
  - Generate new field `readyInMin` by looking at `drink` and `food`. 
  - Example: Ordering *latte + sandwich* ‚Üí prep time = **8 minutes**.  

---

## HTML
- `<form>` with inputs for `name`, `drink`, and `food`.  
- `<table>` displays all current orders with headers for every field.  
  - also uses `th` and `td`
- Single-page interface (`index.html` is the entry point).  
- Passes W3C validation.  

---

## CSS
- **Theme**: cozy fall coffee shop aesthetic - yayüéÉ‚òï  
  - Background: deep brown `rgb(92, 50, 50)`  
  - Fonts: [Handlee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Handlee) (body), [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico) (headings)  
  - Dotted cream borders with rounded corners  
- **Selectors demonstrated**:  
  - Element (`body`, `h1, h2, h3`, `table`, etc.)  
  - Class (`.borderbox`, `.menu`)  
  - ID (`#show-results`, `#submit-btn`) to call different buttons / divs
- **Flexbox layout** used for arranging drinks/food menu side-by-side.  
- Styled table with alternating row colors and vertical/horizontal borders.  
- External `main.css` used with organized, maintainable rules shared amognst different elements  

---

## JavaScript
- **Client-side logic (`main.js`)**  
  - `submit()` ‚Üí sends new order to `/submit`.  
  - `getResults()` ‚Üí fetches all current orders from `/results`.  
  - `updateResults()` ‚Üí redraws the results table dynamically.  
  - Event delegation for **Delete** and **Edit** buttons in each row.  
  - Edit uses `prompt()` popups to allow updating fields inline.  

---

## Node.js
- **Server (`server.improved.js`)**  
  - Uses Node‚Äôs built-in `http` and `fs` modules.  
  - Endpoints:  
    - `GET /` ‚Üí serves homepage  
    - `GET /results` ‚Üí returns dataset in JSON  
    - `POST /submit` ‚Üí adds new order with derived field  
    - `POST /delete` ‚Üí removes order by `id`  
    - `POST /edit` ‚Üí updates fields for an existing order and recalculates prep time , modify existing data

---

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page app**:  
  Form submission, results display, edit, and delete all update without page reloads.  
- **Edit functionality**:  
  Users can modify an existing order directly from the results table.  

---

## Design Achievements
- Coffee shop theme with emojis, fall colors, and custom Google Fonts.  
- Rounded dotted border boxes for a ‚Äúcute, cozy‚Äù aesthetic.  
- **Flexbox** layout for menu presentation.  
- Informal user feedback led to spacing adjustments between menu and results.

## Design / UX (think-aloud)
**1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.**
  Student 1:  Bishop
  Student 2:  Roias

**2. What problems did the user have with your design?**
  Both students mentioned the original layout was not very intutitve and I had a lot of empty space.  Therefore, I ended up moving the order box to be to the right of the menu.  They also noted that the font was too small to see on the menu (which I made bigger using `font-size: larger;`).  They also noted the font istelf was a little mismatched / hard to read, but the overall logic of looking at the table of ordering and being able to delete them there made sense.  They also said the input could be a clickable button or a drop down sicne there is a limited amount of things you can order.

**3. What comments did they make that surprised you?**
I was surprised originally about the input comment as I liked the type in boxes.  But after thinking about it, it does make snese to give them more guided selections as there is a finite number of things they can order.  They also said the brown color was ugly, but I kept it becuase. like it for fall.

**4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?**
I would change the input boxes to be either buttons or drop down for ordering.  I would also update the loopy font since I agree it is a little difficult to read.

## Challenges
Some challenges I faced during this assignment was first getting the actual functionality down.  i started with the starter code input files, added my desried fields `name`, `drink`, and `food` and watching the console to approve that the informaiton was getting back to the code and server.  Once I got the desired `POST` and `GET` requests working and validated the information could be sent and received between the `main.js`, `index.html`, and `server.imporved.js` files.  After the actual logic was working and the base requirments were fufilled, I added things to my `main.css` file to make the UI look nice.  

Playing around with the padding and just the overall layout was a challenge at first since I had to figure out what key words changed different things.  For example, what padding does vs. margin and the differences between flex and grid layouts.

### POST (with Javascript)
- /submit
- /edit
- /delete

### GET
- /results

## AI Usage
I used Chat GPT to explain concepts used in this assignment, but did not have it write any code for me.  AI specifically aided me in understanding how CSS / HTML tags work, the general format of the document, and helped me debug when my image was not showing up on my webpage.
